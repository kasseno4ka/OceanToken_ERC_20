README for your contracts:

 Project:

 This repository contains two smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

Faucet.sol: A faucet contract that allows users to request a certain amount of tokens after a certain period of time.
OceanToken.sol: An ERC20 token contract with a capped supply, burning capabilities, and a miner reward for each block mined.
 Setup and Usage:

 To compile and deploy the contracts, you will need:

Node.js and npm.
Hardhat or Truffle installed.
 Faucet:

Copy the Faucet.sol code to your project folder.
Replace tokenAddress in the constructor with the address of your ERC20 token.
Deploy the Faucet contract.
Users can request tokens by calling the requestTokens function.
 OceanToken:

Copy the OceanToken.sol code to your project folder.
Replace cap and reward in the constructor with your desired values.
Deploy the OceanToken contract.
New tokens are minted on every transfer except from the contract owner, if the token supply has not reached the cap.
The setBlockReward function allows you to change the miner reward.
The destroy function allows the contract owner to destroy the contract and send the remaining tokens to their address.
